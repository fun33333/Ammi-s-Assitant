# **PROBLEM: AMMI’S AI DINNER ASSISTANT**

## **Problem Context**

Every day, Ammi asks the same question:   
**|**     “Aaj khanay mein kya banaun?” 

The fridge is full, but ideas are scarce. And if no one answers…   
**|**     “Chalo phir daal hi paka leti hoon”

This leads to:

* Repetitive meals and boredom  
* Wasted ingredients  
* Daily decision fatigue for Ammi and family

Your challenge is to design a **web-based AI Recipe Assistant** that helps families plan meals smarter, faster, and more creatively. The solution should suggest meals based on available ingredients, avoid repetition, and make dinnertime less stressful and more fun.

---

## **Your Mission**

Your team has **5–6 hours** to design and prototype an AI-powered web app that:

* Suggests multiple recipe options based on available ingredients  
* Considers user preferences (time, spice level, dietary needs)  
* Makes meal planning fun and stress-free

---

## **Core Modules to Build (Teams May Implement Two or More)**

* **Ingredient Inventory & Meal Matching**

Keep track of ingredients in the fridge or pantry. Suggest meals that can be made with what’s available.

**Key Requirements:**  
Add, view, and search ingredients

* **Daily Meal Suggestions & Recipe Guidance**

Recommend daily dinner options considering past meals to avoid repetition. Optionally include simple step-by-step recipes.

**Key Requirements:**  
Suggest multiple meal options  
Optionally provide recipe instructions

* **Leftover & Waste Alerts**

Notify when ingredients are about to expire and suggest meals to reduce food waste.

**Key Requirements:**  
Track expiry dates  
Alert for unused or near-expiry ingredients

* **Dashboard & Analytics**

Summarize weekly meal trends, ingredient usage, most cooked dishes, and potential food waste savings.

**Key Requirements:**  
Weekly summary of meals prepared  
Most frequently used ingredients and dishes  
Estimated reduction in wasted food

* **Optional Gamification / Fun Features**

Score meals, reward creative combos, or track family cooking history

## **AI Feature Requirement**

Teams **must integrate AI or rule-based logic in at least one module**. 

**Example AI features include (but are not limited to):**

* **AI Recipe Suggestion Engine:** Generate recipes based on ingredients and preferences

* **Smart Ranking:** Recommend the best recipes based on time, dietary needs, or popularity

* **Waste Reduction Logic:** Suggest meals using near-expiry ingredients

**Note:** Teams are not restricted to these examples and may implement their own AI-driven features.

**Key Requirements:**

* AI or rule-based logic must provide meaningful suggestions or guidance  
* Must work smoothly without blocking the UI

---

## **Backend & System Architecture Guidance**

* Backend to store and retrieve ingredients, preferences, and meal history  
* Database (relational or NoSQL) for managing data  
* AI component integrated into at least one module  
* Optional: Cloud functions, asynchronous tasks, or caching for performance

---

## **Functional Prototype Requirement**

Teams must demonstrate:

* At least **two fully functional core modules**  
* Web UI (Optional: Responsive Design)  
* **AI feature** integrated in at least one module  
* Either real or simulated data

---

## **Deliverables**

* Working prototype (minimum 2 core modules functional)  
* Dashboard/UI for families  
* AI logic integrated (recipe suggestions, ranking, or waste alerts)  
* Architecture diagram  
* Pitch deck
